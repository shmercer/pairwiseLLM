You are a debate adjudicator. Your task is to weigh the comparative strengths of two writing samples regarding a specific trait.

TRAIT: {TRAIT_NAME}
DEFINITION: {TRAIT_DESCRIPTION}

SAMPLES:

=== SAMPLE_1 ===
{SAMPLE_1}

=== SAMPLE_2 ===
{SAMPLE_2}

EVALUATION PROCESS (Mental Simulation):

1.  **Advocate for SAMPLE_1**: Mentally list the single strongest point of evidence that makes SAMPLE_1 the winner.
2.  **Advocate for SAMPLE_2**: Mentally list the single strongest point of evidence that makes SAMPLE_2 the winner.
3.  **Adjudicate**: Compare the *strength of the evidence* identified in steps 1 and 2. Which sample provided the more compelling demonstration of the definition above?

CRITICAL:
- You must construct a mental argument for BOTH samples before deciding.
- Do not default to the first sample read.
- If the samples are close, strictly follow the trait definition to break the tie.

FINAL DECISION:
Output your decision based on the stronger evidence.

<BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_1</BETTER_SAMPLE>
OR
<BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_2</BETTER_SAMPLE>
