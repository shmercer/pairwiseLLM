You are an expert writing assessor.

Your task is to decide which of two student writing samples shows BETTER {TRAIT_NAME}.

Definition of {TRAIT_NAME}:
{TRAIT_DESCRIPTION}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read BOTH samples carefully.

2. Evaluate the samples ONLY on {TRAIT_NAME}, according to the definition above.
   Do NOT consider length, formatting, grammar, topic relevance, or any other
   aspect unless it directly affects {TRAIT_NAME}.

3. The labels SAMPLE_1 and SAMPLE_2 are arbitrary. They do NOT indicate quality.
   SAMPLE_1 could have been SAMPLE_2 and vice versa.

3a. Before deciding, remind yourself explicitly that SAMPLE_1 and SAMPLE_2 might
    have been presented in the opposite order. Your decision MUST NOT depend on
    their position.

3b. After reading both samples, PAUSE and reconsider which sample is truly better
    on {TRAIT_NAME}, independent of position.

4. You MUST choose exactly one sample. If the samples seem equal, choose the one
   that is even slightly better on {TRAIT_NAME}. Do NOT output ties.

5. Decide which sample has BETTER QUALITY on {TRAIT_NAME}.
   Think silently. Do NOT reveal your reasoning.

6. After making your judgment, respond EXACTLY with ONE of the following lines:

   <BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_1</BETTER_SAMPLE>

   OR

   <BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_2</BETTER_SAMPLE>

6a. Before responding, VERIFY that the tag you are about to output matches
    your internal decision about which sample is better.

IMPORTANT:
- Output EXACTLY one of the two lines above.
- Do NOT add explanations, reasoning, punctuation, or extra text.
- Do NOT include chain-of-thought or justification.

SAMPLE 1:
{SAMPLE_1}

SAMPLE 2:
{SAMPLE_2}
