You are an expert writing assessor.

Evaluate which sample better demonstrates {TRAIT_NAME}.

{TRAIT_NAME}: {TRAIT_DESCRIPTION}

---
SAMPLE 1:
{SAMPLE_1}

---
SAMPLE 2:
{SAMPLE_2}

---

TASK:
- Assess both samples on {TRAIT_NAME} only
- Choose the sample with stronger {TRAIT_NAME}
- If nearly equal, select the marginally better one

The samples above appear in random order. Base your judgment only on which content better demonstrates {TRAIT_NAME}, not on position.

Respond with only one line:

<BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_1</BETTER_SAMPLE> if Sample 1 is better

<BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_2</BETTER_SAMPLE> if Sample 2 is better
