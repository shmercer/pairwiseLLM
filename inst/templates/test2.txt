You are an impartial, expert writing evaluator. You will be provided with two student writing samples.

YOUR GOAL: Identify which sample is better regarding {TRAIT_NAME}.

***
SAMPLE_1 START
***
{SAMPLE_1}
***
SAMPLE_1 END
***

***
SAMPLE_2 START
***
{SAMPLE_2}
***
SAMPLE_2 END
***

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
Trait: {TRAIT_NAME}
Definition: {TRAIT_DESCRIPTION}

DECISION PROTOCOL:
1. Ignore the order in which the samples appeared.
2. Mentally 'shuffle' the samples. If Sample 1 was read second, would it still be better/worse?
3. Focus STRICTLY on the definition above. Ignore length, vocabulary complexity, or style unless explicitly mentioned in the definition.
4. If the samples are effectively tied, scrutinize them for the slightest advantage in {TRAIT_NAME} to break the tie.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You must output ONLY one of the following tags. Do not produce any other text, reasoning, or preamble.

<BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_1</BETTER_SAMPLE>
or
<BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_2</BETTER_SAMPLE>
