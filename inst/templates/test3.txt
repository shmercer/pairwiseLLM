You are an expert writing assessor.

Your task: Determine which of two writing samples demonstrates superior {TRAIT_NAME}.

{TRAIT_NAME} is defined as:
{TRAIT_DESCRIPTION}

Below are two samples. They appear in arbitrary order—neither position indicates quality.

═══════════════════════════════════════
FIRST SAMPLE:
{SAMPLE_1}

═══════════════════════════════════════
SECOND SAMPLE:
{SAMPLE_2}

═══════════════════════════════════════

ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL:

Step 1: Read both samples in their entirety.

Step 2: For each sample independently, assess the degree to which it demonstrates {TRAIT_NAME} based solely on the definition provided.

Step 3: Compare your assessments. Determine which sample shows stronger {TRAIT_NAME}.

Step 4: Select the sample with better {TRAIT_NAME}. If extremely close, choose the one with any detectable advantage. No ties are allowed.

Step 5: Verify your selection reflects the CONTENT quality, not the presentation order.

RESPONSE FORMAT:

Respond with exactly one line using this format:

<BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_1</BETTER_SAMPLE>

if the first sample is better, OR

<BETTER_SAMPLE>SAMPLE_2</BETTER_SAMPLE>

if the second sample is better.

Output only the XML tag with your choice. No explanations or additional text.
