\title{Identify misfit judges from a BT fit}
\usage{
judge_misfit_judges(fit, fit_bounds = c(0.7, 1.3), max_n = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A list returned by \code{\link[=fit_bt_model]{fit_bt_model()}} or a data frame/tibble with
judge fit columns.}

\item{fit_bounds}{Numeric vector of length 2 giving acceptable bounds for
\code{infit} and \code{outfit}. Default is \code{c(0.7, 1.3)}.}

\item{max_n}{Optional non-negative integer limiting the number of judge IDs
returned. Use \code{Inf} to return all misfit judges. Default is \code{Inf}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of judge IDs flagged as misfit.
}
\description{
Convenience wrapper around \code{\link[=judge_fit_summary]{judge_fit_summary()}} that returns the judge IDs
flagged as misfit (outside \code{fit_bounds}) based on infit/outfit diagnostics.
}
\details{
If the input fit object does not contain judge-fit diagnostics, this
function returns an empty character vector.
}
\examples{
fit <- list(
  diagnostics = list(
    judge_fit = tibble::tibble(
      judge = c("mA", "mB"),
      infit = c(1.0, 1.6),
      outfit = c(1.1, 1.0)
    )
  )
)
judge_misfit_judges(fit)
