\title{Identify misfitting judges from a Bradley--Terry fit}
\usage{
judge_misfit_judges(fit, fit_bounds = c(0.7, 1.3))
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fit object accepted by \code{\link[=judge_fit_summary]{judge_fit_summary()}}.}

\item{fit_bounds}{Numeric length-2 vector giving acceptable fit bounds for
\code{infit} and \code{outfit}.}
}
\value{
Character vector of judge IDs flagged as misfitting, sorted by
decreasing deviation.
}
\description{
Convenience wrapper around \code{\link[=judge_fit_summary]{judge_fit_summary()}} that returns the judge IDs
flagged as misfitting (based on \code{fit_bounds}).
}
\details{
When no judge-fit diagnostics are available, this function returns a
zero-length character vector.
}
\examples{
fit <- list(
  diagnostics = list(
    judge_fit = tibble::tibble(
      judge = c("mA", "mB"),
      infit = c(1.0, 1.6),
      outfit = c(1.1, 1.0)
    )
  )
)
judge_misfit_judges(fit)
