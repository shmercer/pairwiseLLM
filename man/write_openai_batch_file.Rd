\title{Write OpenAI batch JSONL lines to a file}
\usage{
write_openai_batch_file(batch_tbl, path)
}
\arguments{
\item{batch_tbl}{A data frame or tibble produced by
\code{\link{build_openai_batch_requests}} with a \code{jsonl} column
containing one JSON object (as a character string) per row.}

\item{path}{File path to write to (e.g., \code{"openai_batch.jsonl"}).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input \code{batch_tbl}.
}
\description{
This is a small convenience wrapper around the output of
\code{\link{build_openai_batch_requests}}. It takes a tibble with a
\code{jsonl} column (one JSON object per row) and writes those lines
to a file suitable for uploading to the OpenAI Batch API.
