\title{Summarize judge fit diagnostics from a Bradley--Terry fit}
\usage{
judge_fit_summary(fit, fit_bounds = c(0.7, 1.3), top_n = 5L)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{Either a list returned by \code{\link{fit_bt_model}} (recommended),
or a data frame/tibble with judge fit columns.}

\item{fit_bounds}{Numeric vector of length 2 giving acceptable bounds for
\code{infit} and \code{outfit}. Default is \code{c(0.7, 1.3)}.}

\item{top_n}{Integer. Number of worst judges (by max of infit/outfit deviation)
to return in the \code{worst_judges} field of the summary. Default is 5.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{summary}{One-row tibble with overall judge-fit summary statistics.}
\item{details}{A tibble with one row per judge, including a \code{is_misfit}
flag.}
}
}
\description{
This helper extracts and summarizes judge-level fit diagnostics
(e.g., infit/outfit) when using a modeling engine that provides them
(notably \pkg{sirt} via \code{\link[sirt]{btm}}).
}
\details{
It is designed to work with the object returned by \code{\link{fit_bt_model}},
but will also accept a data frame/tibble that already looks like a judge-fit
table (with columns \code{judge}, \code{infit}, and \code{outfit}).
}
\examples{
fit <- list(
  diagnostics = list(
    judge_fit = tibble::tibble(
      judge = c("mA", "mB"),
      infit = c(1.0, 1.6),
      outfit = c(1.1, 1.0)
    )
  )
)
judge_fit_summary(fit)$summary
