\title{Summarize pairwise comparison results by judge}
\usage{
judge_summary(results, judge_col = "judge", compute_reverse = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A data frame or tibble with columns \code{ID1}, \code{ID2},
and \code{better_id}. Additional columns are allowed.}

\item{judge_col}{Character scalar giving the column name that identifies
the judge/model.}

\item{compute_reverse}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), attempt to compute
forward-vs-reverse consistency within each judge by splitting the rows into
a "main" direction (lexicographically smaller ID in \code{ID1}) and a
"reverse" direction (lexicographically larger ID in \code{ID1}). If no
unordered pairs appear in both directions, the reverse-consistency fields
are returned as \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
A list with two tibbles:
\describe{
\item{by_judge}{One row per judge with descriptive statistics.}
\item{overall}{One-row tibble with the same statistics computed across
all judges combined.}
}
}
\description{
This helper produces descriptive statistics about a results table
grouped by a judge/model identifier column.
}
\details{
The input should follow the standard pairwiseLLM results schema
with columns \code{ID1}, \code{ID2}, and \code{better_id} (the winning ID).
The judge column is specified via \code{judge_col}.

In addition to basic counts (valid rows, invalid winners, etc.), this
helper reports a quick positional check (how often position 1 wins), and
an optional forward-vs-reverse consistency check when both orderings are
present for some unordered pairs.

  judge = c("m1", "m1", "m2", "m2")
