\title{Summarize adaptive refits}
\usage{
summarize_refits(state, last_n = NULL, include_optional = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{An \code{adaptive_state} or list containing adaptive logs.}

\item{last_n}{Optional positive integer; return only the last \code{n} rows.}

\item{include_optional}{Logical; include optional diagnostic columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per refit.
}
\description{
Build a per-refit diagnostics summary from the adaptive round log. This is
a pure view over \code{round_log} and does not recompute metrics.
}
\details{
The round log is the canonical stop-audit trail and groups fields by
identity/cadence, run-scale counts, design knobs, coverage/imbalance,
posterior percentiles, diagnostics, stop quality metrics, stop bookkeeping,
stop decision, candidate health, and MCMC configuration. Run-scale counts
include scheduled/completed pairs and \code{backlog_unjudged} (scheduled
minus completed). Percentile columns are fixed (e.g.,
\code{epsilon_p2.5}, \code{epsilon_p50}, \code{epsilon_p97.5}) and remain
present with \code{NA} values when a parameter is not part of a model
variant. Stopping metrics report posterior quality (e.g.,
\code{reliability_EAP}) and stability checks (e.g.,
\code{rank_stability_pass}) without recomputation.
