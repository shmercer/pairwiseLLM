\title{Summarize adaptive iterations}
\usage{
summarize_iterations(state, last_n = NULL, include_optional = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{An \code{adaptive_state} or list containing adaptive logs.}

\item{last_n}{Optional positive integer; return only the last \code{n} rows.}

\item{include_optional}{Logical; include optional diagnostic columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per iteration.
}
\description{
Build a per-iteration diagnostics summary from the adaptive batch log. This
is a pure view over \code{batch_log} and does not recompute metrics.
}
\details{
Run-scale iteration counts reflect a single scheduling cycle. The batch log
records \code{n_pairs_selected} (pairs scheduled this iteration),
\code{n_pairs_completed} (newly observed since the previous log),
\code{n_pairs_failed} (newly failed attempts since the previous log), and
\code{backlog_unjudged} (scheduled minus completed, measured after
scheduling). Candidate health is captured by \code{candidate_starved} when
fewer than the target pairs are selected.
