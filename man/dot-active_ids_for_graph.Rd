\title{Determine the active ID set for graph-health calculations}
\usage{
.active_ids_for_graph(core_ids, batches, batch_i, results_so_far)
}
\arguments{
\item{core_ids}{Character vector of core IDs.}

\item{batches}{List of character vectors (batch ID requests).}

\item{batch_i}{Integer index of the current batch (1-based).}

\item{results_so_far}{Results data.frame/tibble with columns ID1/ID2.}
}
\value{
Sorted unique character vector of active IDs.
}
\description{
Batched runners may have access to a larger universe of sample IDs than are
currently "in play" for a given batch/round. Graph-health gating should only
consider IDs that are active:
\itemize{
\item core IDs
\item IDs introduced by the batches up to and including the current batch
\item IDs that appear in the accumulated results so far
}
}
