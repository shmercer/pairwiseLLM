\title{Compute a simple cosine-similarity neighbor list from an embeddings matrix.}
\usage{
.compute_embedding_neighbors(embeddings, ids, k = 30L, normalize = TRUE)
}
\description{
This is intentionally lightweight (no ANN dependency) and intended for
moderate n (e.g., up to a few thousand) where a single dense similarity
computation is acceptable.
