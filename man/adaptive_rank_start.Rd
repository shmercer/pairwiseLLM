\usage{
adaptive_rank_start(
  items,
  seed = 1L,
  session_dir = NULL,
  persist_item_log = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{items}{A vector or data frame of items. Data frames must include an
\code{item_id} column (or \code{id}/\code{ID}). Item IDs may be character; internal logs
use integer indices derived from these IDs.}

\item{seed}{Integer seed used for deterministic warm-start shuffling and
selection randomness.}

\item{session_dir}{Optional directory for saving session artifacts.}

\item{persist_item_log}{Logical; when TRUE, write per-refit item logs to disk.}

\item{...}{Internal/testing only. Supply \code{now_fn} to override the clock used
for timestamps.}
}
\value{
An adaptive state object containing \code{step_log}, \code{round_log}, and
\code{item_log}.
}
\description{
Creates an adaptive state object with canonical logs. Pair selection and
stepwise execution are implemented in later steps.
