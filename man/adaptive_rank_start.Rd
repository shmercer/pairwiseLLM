adaptive_rank_start(items, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{items}{A vector or data frame of items. Data frames must include an
\code{item_id} column (or \code{id}/\code{ID}). Item IDs may be character; internal logs
use integer indices derived from these IDs.}

\item{...}{Internal/testing only. Supply \code{now_fn} to override the clock used
for timestamps.}
}
\value{
An Adaptive v2 state object containing \code{step_log}, \code{round_log}, and
\code{item_log}.
}
