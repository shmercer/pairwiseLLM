\title{Synthetic Writing Samples with Controlled Quality Levels (N = 1000)}
\format{
A tibble with 1,000 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
\item{ID}{Character. Unique sample identifier (S0001–S1000).}
\item{text}{Character. The writing sample (approximately 120–180 words).}
\item{quality_level}{Integer. Intended quality level used during generation (1–20).}
\item{theta_true}{Numeric. Centered latent-quality proxy derived from
\code{quality_level}.}
\item{prompt_id}{Character. Identifier for the generation prompt template.}
\item{model}{Character. Language model used to generate the samples.}
\item{created_at}{POSIXct. Timestamp (UTC) when the samples were generated.}
}
}
\source{
Generated via live OpenAI API calls using a controlled, bucketed quality prompt.

\description{
A synthetic dataset of 1,000 short writing samples generated by a large
language model for use in pairwise comparison and ranking experiments.
}
\details{
Samples are generated in 20 discrete quality levels (1 = lowest, 20 = highest),
with multiple responses per level. Quality levels are intended to represent
overlapping ranges of overall writing quality rather than a strict total
ordering, allowing for realistic noise and near-ties in pairwise judgments.

All samples respond to the same writing prompt to avoid topic effects. The
dataset is primarily intended for benchmarking ranking models and for
comparing random versus adaptive pair selection strategies under limited
judgment budgets.

The column \code{theta_true} provides a centered numeric proxy for the latent
quality dimension derived from \code{quality_level}. This proxy is intended
for evaluation purposes (e.g., rank recovery or correlation) and does not
imply a perfectly ordered ground truth at the individual-sample level.
