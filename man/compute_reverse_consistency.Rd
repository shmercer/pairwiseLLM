\title{Compute consistency between forward and reverse pair comparisons}
\usage{
compute_reverse_consistency(main_results, reverse_results)
}
\arguments{
\item{main_results}{A data frame or tibble containing pairwise
comparison results for the "forward" ordering of pairs, with
columns \code{ID1}, \code{ID2}, and \code{better_id}.}

\item{reverse_results}{A data frame or tibble containing results
for the corresponding "reverse" ordering, with the same column
requirements.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{summary}: a tibble with one row and columns
\code{n_pairs}, \code{n_consistent}, and \code{prop_consistent}.
Here, \code{n_pairs} counts unordered pair keys with a non-missing
majority winner in both directions.
\item \code{details}: a tibble with one row per unordered pair key,
including columns \code{key}, \code{ID1_main}, \code{ID2_main},
\code{ID1_rev}, \code{ID2_rev}, \code{better_id_main},
\code{better_id_rev}, and \code{is_consistent}. Additional columns
provide vote counts and tie flags.
}
}
\description{
Given two data frames of pairwise comparison results (one for
the "forward" ordering of pairs, one for the "reverse" ordering),
this function identifies unordered pairs that were evaluated in both
directions and computes the proportion of consistent judgments.
}
\details{
Consistency is defined at the level of IDs: a pair is consistent
if the same ID is selected as better in both directions. This function
assumes each input contains columns \code{ID1}, \code{ID2}, and
\code{better_id}, where \code{better_id} is the ID of the better sample
(not "SAMPLE_1"/"SAMPLE_2").

\strong{Per-key majority agreement (duplicates supported).}
If a pair appears multiple times in \code{main_results} and/or
\code{reverse_results} (e.g., submitted twice), this function aggregates
each unordered pair key separately in each direction and takes the
\emph{majority} \code{better_id}. If there is a tie for the majority
winner within a direction, that direction's majority winner is set to
\code{NA} and the key is excluded from the consistency calculation.

The output \code{details} contains exactly one row per unordered pair key,
which keeps it compatible with \code{\link{check_positional_bias}}.
