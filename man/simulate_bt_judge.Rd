\title{Simulate a judge for BT pairwise comparisons}
\usage{
simulate_bt_judge(
  pairs,
  true_theta,
  judges = "judge_1",
  judge_col = NULL,
  deterministic = FALSE,
  seed = NULL,
  round_robin = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pairs}{A tibble/data.frame with columns \code{ID1}, \code{text1}, \code{ID2}, \code{text2}.}

\item{true_theta}{Named numeric vector of latent abilities. Names must include
the IDs used in \code{pairs}. Missing IDs are treated as 0.}

\item{judges}{Optional character vector of judge identifiers. If length > 1,
each row is assigned a judge (round-robin by default).}

\item{judge_col}{Optional character scalar column name to use for judge labels.
If \code{NULL} (default), no judge column is returned.}

\item{deterministic}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, always choose the higher \code{true_theta}.
If equal, break ties at random (seed-controlled). Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer seed; RNG state is restored afterwards.}

\item{round_robin}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default) and \code{length(judges) > 1},
assign judges in repeating order. If \code{FALSE}, assign judges uniformly at random.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{ID1}, \code{ID2}, \code{better_id}, and optionally
a judge column.
}
\description{
This helper produces synthetic pairwise comparison results for testing,
vignettes, and benchmarking. It takes a table of pairs (with texts) and returns
\code{better_id} outcomes based on a latent "true ability" vector.
}
\details{
The simulator can be deterministic (always pick higher true ability) or
stochastic using a Bradley–Terry / logistic probability model.

\examples{
pairs <- tibble::tibble(
  ID1 = c("A", "B"),
  text1 = c("a", "b"),
  ID2 = c("C", "D"),

)
true_theta <- c(A = 2, B = 1, C = 0, D = -1)
