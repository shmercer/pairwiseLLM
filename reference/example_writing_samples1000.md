# Synthetic Writing Samples with Controlled Quality Levels (N = 1000)

A synthetic dataset of 1,000 short writing samples generated by a large
language model for use in pairwise comparison and ranking experiments.

## Usage

``` r
data("example_writing_samples1000")
```

## Format

A tibble with 1,000 rows and 7 variables:

- ID:

  Character. Unique sample identifier (S0001–S1000).

- text:

  Character. The writing sample (approximately 120–180 words).

- quality_level:

  Integer. Intended quality level used during generation (1–20).

- theta_true:

  Numeric. Centered latent-quality proxy derived from `quality_level`.

- prompt_id:

  Character. Identifier for the generation prompt template.

- model:

  Character. Language model used to generate the samples.

- created_at:

  POSIXct. Timestamp (UTC) when the samples were generated.

## Source

Generated via live OpenAI API calls using a controlled, bucketed quality
prompt. See `data-raw/generate_example_writing_samples1000.R` for
details.

## Details

Samples are generated in 20 discrete quality levels (1 = lowest, 20 =
highest), with multiple responses per level. Quality levels are intended
to represent overlapping ranges of overall writing quality rather than a
strict total ordering, allowing for realistic noise and near-ties in
pairwise judgments.

All samples respond to the same writing prompt to avoid topic effects.
The dataset is primarily intended for benchmarking ranking models and
for comparing random versus adaptive pair selection strategies under
limited judgment budgets.

The column `theta_true` provides a centered numeric proxy for the latent
quality dimension derived from `quality_level`. This proxy is intended
for evaluation purposes (e.g., rank recovery or correlation) and does
not imply a perfectly ordered ground truth at the individual-sample
level.
